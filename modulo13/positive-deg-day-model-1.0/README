There are two implementations:

a) PDD_noSD
The positive degree-day model calculates surface melt based on air temperature, distinguishing between snow and ice melt.
Accumulation is taken from precipitation using a temperature threshold.

Required input:
2D field of temperature, precipitation, glacier mask


b) PDD_inklSD
The positive degree-day model calculates surface melt based on air temperature, distinguising between snow and ice melt. 
Accumulation is taken from precipitation using a temperature threshold.
The resulting snowfall is adjusted by a parametrization for snowdrift (slightly modified based on Warscher et al. 2013, Water Resources Research). Grid cells are analyzed for the exposition/shelter to wind by a directed sky view factor and corrected accordingly. A look-up table for sky-view factors in 5 degree steps can be calculated with the script LUT_SVFdir45.py

Required input:
DEM, timeseries of wind direction and velocities, glacier MASK, aspect, slope
2D field of temperature, precipitation
