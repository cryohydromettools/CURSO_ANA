The simplified energy balance model calculates the surface mass balance based on air temperature and radiation. Radiation can be global or potential.
Accumulation is taken from the precipitation using a temperature threshold.
The snowfall is adjusted by a parametrization for snowdrift (slightly modified based on Warscher et al. 2013, Water Resources Research). Grid cells are analyzed for the exposition/shelter to wind by a directed sky view factor and corrected accordingly. A look-up table for sky-view factors in 5 degree steps can be calculated with the script LUT_SVFdir45.py

Required input:
DEM, timeseries of wind direction and velocities, glacier MASK, aspect, slope
2D field of temperature, precipitation and radiation
